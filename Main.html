          <h2>The Light Roast</h2>
          <p>
            Light roast is now a thing. It's not just for people who don't like strong coffee anymore
            it's also for those who want to enjoy their morning cup of joe without that heavy feeling in their stomach.
            Now there are more options than ever before!
            You can have your cake and eat it too with these new lighter roasts.

          <h2>The Middle Roast</h2>
          <p>
            Medium roast coffee is a brown color and rarely has an oily surface. These coffees have a medium acidity and body,
            as well as a rounded flavor profile. Roasting to this level also preserves many of the unique flavors of the coffee's origin,
            but it also begins to reach into the deep caramel sweetness of a longer roast.

          <h2>The Dark Roast</h2>
          <p>
            Dark roast coffee beans stay on the roasting machine for longer and at a higher temperature than light roasted beans.
            To be considered dark, beans need to be roasted to a temperature higher than 430 degrees 
            (but not much hotter than 440 degrees), which is the end of the second crack.
